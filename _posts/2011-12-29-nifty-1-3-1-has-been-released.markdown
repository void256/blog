  content: You can't run the nifty-examples.jar as is, sorry! It contains lots of
    different example project too, so there is not a single example available. You'll
    need to get the source and check the source.

    I know that you mean that one :) It is still there in the nifty-examples project and it has been extended for 1.3.1 quite a bit too. It's just not (yet ^^) available online and it can't be run with the nifty-examples.jar only. You'll need to get the source (preferable as a direct git clone) to see it in action.

    This is simply a problem with lack of time or you could even say I simply forgot to put it online ;-)

    I'll see what I can do. Probably around next weekend or so to get it online as a webstart. What do you say? ;)

    Thanks ... unfortunately I can't successfully load the screenshot :&#47; Somehow it's veeeeeery slow :&#47;

    Any chance that you host it somewhere else? I'd really want to see it! :-)

  content: "New feature wise, I think the biggest thing that keeps me from using this
    on major projects is the lack of a text input area that can deal with wrapping.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I think being able to specify rotations for images (or elements in general?) would
    be terribly useful.  Or, similarly, the ability to render something from a BufferedImage
    instead of being tied only to the filesystem."

    is actually implemented for java2d renderer as well, so I might have to look into
    that. Thanks for the pointer, cghislai!

  content: Since Nifty doesn't have build-in rotation matrix support you can't have
    that out of the box. You could try it writing your own custom Nifty effect and
    doing the math (and the transformation) by yourself. But there is nothing similar
    available as an example - at least nothing I'm aware of. You could also try to
    ask in the Nifty Forum at sf.net for help. Seems interessting enough for me to
    try it ... maybe I'll take a look when time permits but I can't promise anything
    :)

    The MessageBox control does not yet provide any feedback about the buttons that have been pressed as far as I can see. It just displays a message. You might want to add a feature request on github so we can add this for a later release: https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;void256&#47;nifty-gui&#47;issues?state=open

    This being said ... as a workaround you could try to access the button controls using findControl or findElementByName starting at the popup element and then add a setOnClick() callback there. But I've not tried this yet. Might be a bit rough :)

<p>Here are some informations about Nifty 1.3.1.</p>
<p><strong>GC and other speed improvements as well as Bugfixes<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Nifty 1.3.1 should be compatible with 1.3. Its main purpose is improved performance. Nifty has been optimized for better GC performance as well as render performance. You should see more FPS with this version!</p>
<p><strong>Additional standard controls<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Thanks to contributions of Nifty user ractoc you can now find a TabsControl, a TreeBoxControl, a ChatControl and a MessageBox in the nifty-default-controls project!</p>
<p><strong>Improved Slick2D Renderer<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Nifty user mkaring the Slick2D renderer has been greatly updated and improved. So Nifty should work a lot better with Slick2D again.</p>
<p><strong>LWJGL 2.8.2<&#47;strong></p>
<p>And last but not least Nifty has been updated to the latest stable LWJGL version 2.8.2. Which was easy since thanks to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.gemserk.com&#47;">gemserk<&#47;a> LWJGL is in the central maven repository!</p>
<p>Nifty 1.3.1 is not yet in the central. There are still a couple of jars in the Nifty universe that are not available in the central but we're working on it!</p>
