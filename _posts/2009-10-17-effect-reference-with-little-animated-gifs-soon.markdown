<p>Ok, I was not able to add a effect reference each day but there was some progress, which is good.</p>
<p>Today I added "imageSize" and I've started to add little code snippets and animated gifs to the reference page too. So that the explanation makes more sense and you'll get some code to start with.</p>
<p>I'll continue to add effects documentation over the coming weeks :)</p>
<p>And here is the first with gif and code:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;apps&#47;mediawiki&#47;nifty-gui&#47;index.php?title=Effects#imageSize">http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;apps&#47;mediawiki&#47;nifty-gui&#47;index.php?title=Effects#imageSize<&#47;a></p>
<p>Have fun,<br />
void</p>
