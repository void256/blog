    PS: Make sure you'll add Nifty to your ohloh.net stack! =)

<p>Nifty documentation is currently scattered around the internet.</p>
<p>You can find some pieces in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;apps&#47;mediawiki&#47;nifty-gui&#47;index.php?title=Main_Page">Nifty wiki<&#47;a>, on the blog that you're reading right now, in forums like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;nifty-gui&#47;forums&#47;forum&#47;807893">Nifty Forum<&#47;a> at sf.net or the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jmonkeyengine.org&#47;groups&#47;gui&#47;forum&#47;">jMonkeyEngine GUI<&#47;a> Forum. Basically you have some bits of knowledge here and others somewhere else.</p>
<p>Therefore something we'd really like to do was to consolidate all of Niftys documentation into one single information hub. And so we did ... and we're now proud to present to you:</p>
<p><strong>Nifty GUI 1.3.1 - The Missing Manual<&#47;strong></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_383" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Nifty GUI 1.3.1 - The Missing Manual"]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;nifty-gui&#47;files&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-gui-the-manual-v1.0.pdf&#47;download"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.lessvoid.com&#47;wp-content&#47;2011&#47;12&#47;nifty-book-cover-300x211.jpg" alt="" title="Nifty GUI 1.3.1 - The Missing Manual" width="300" height="211" class="size-medium wp-image-383" &#47;><&#47;a>[&#47;caption]</p>
<p>The PDF is an epic 110 pages book <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;nifty-gui&#47;files&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-gui-the-manual-v1.0.pdf&#47;download">hosted at sf.net<&#47;a> that explains (almost) everything that you ever wanted to know about Nifty! The book will act as both a tutorial&#47;introduction to Nifty as well as an in depth reference of the more complicated matters. The PDF contains lots of code examples, screenshots and illustrations.</p>
<p>I hope you had a great christmas 2011 and that you'll enjoy reading the manual! :D</p>
<p>void</p>
<p>PS: In other news Nifty 1.3.1 has been released! <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;projects&#47;nifty-gui&#47;files&#47;nifty-gui&#47;1.3.1&#47;">Get it at sf.net<&#47;a> while it's hot! I'll write a proper blog post about 1.3.1 as soon as I've got the complete changelog together ;)</p>
