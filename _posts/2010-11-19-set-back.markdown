  content: My sympathies! While you're getting everything back up and running, you
    might wanna check out the latest version of the jMonkeyPlatform, where NiftyGUI

<p>Crashing Hard Drives suck!</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know, that one of my Hard Drives suddenly stopped working yesterday evening. Too bad it was part of a two disc RAID 0 =) And too bad most of the sources that I was working on where stored there too >_< Well, most of it is of course commited to the sourceforge.net svn server so there is not much data lost but it's annoying to set everything up again.</p>
<p>Really. Annoying.</p>
<p>void</p>
