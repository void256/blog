  content: "These days I'm dreaming of strangling you with wet noodles!\r\n\r\nI'm
    *trying* to have nifty interact with jME3 but it's coming down to be a week-long
    effort concluding in pretty much nothing.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to interact with
    nifty elements outside from the ScreenController? Every time I try to access the
    assetManager while nifty is up on the screen assetManager is null. :&#47; Also,
    while I'm outside the ScreenController, generating stuff, nifty's screen refuses
    to update. Why is that?\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm starting to be really ... in a real
    bad mood. :(\r\n\r\nIf you could come and help, I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;jmonkeyengine.org&#47;groups&#47;gui&#47;forum&#47;topic&#47;anyone-succeeded-in-changing-text-in-nifty-programatically&#47;?_wpnonce=5c8b8eaa89#post-109514"

    take a look.

  content: "Uhm, I don't know what you tried to tell me with that link erlend :-)
    but when I click it, it will only forward me to the main .org site and I see the
    blog. I'm a bit confused now :D\r\n\r\nLast weekend the GUI forum was pretty quiet,
    so I haven't checked it the last couple of days up until today when I noticed
    that there has been a lot of Nifty related threads ^^ and I'd really appreciate
    a working email notification so that I can respond quicker to some of the posts
    ... especially the ones with \"burn\", \"flames\" and \"ashes\" in the topics!
    ;-)\r\n\r\nI'd be happy with RSS too but when I try to bookmark the http:&#47;&#47;jmonkeyengine.org&#47;groups&#47;gui&#47;forum&#47;feed&#47;
    I only get some firefox xml error >_<\r\n\r\nSo any help on the notification issue
    would be greatly appreciated :) I'm probably just too stupid to hit the right
    buttons or something..."

  content: "Oh, I suppose you weren't logged in. If you were, that page should take
    you to the notification settings for the GUI forum, where you can opt in for e-mail
    notification.\r\n\r\nAnyways, if you're logged in and browsing the GUI forum you
    should see the following group tabs:\r\n\r\nHome\r\nAdmin\r\nForum\r\nMembers
    (43)\r\nEmail Options (This is the important one! :D )"

    think the problem is, that there is no http:&#47;&#47;jmonkeyengine.org&#47;groups&#47;gui&#47;notifications&#47;
    there is http:&#47;&#47;jmonkeyengine.org&#47;groups&#47;nifty-gui&#47;notifications&#47;
    for instance.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm confused =)"

  content: can you check the progressbar.xml? I think there was a bug (that I've commited
    a bugfix for one minute ago) in the controlDefinition. the version in svn works
    now. it was just a little issue with requestings elements with id starting with
    "#" while the controlDefinition in xml did not. Not sure which version you have
    available in a - probably nightly (?) build - of jme. but yes, the progressbar
    should work (at least now :)

    looks good. Any chance that you can join irc:&#47;&#47;freenode&#47;niftygui so
    that we can fix that directly? I should be there each day from 21:00 - 22:00 UTC&#47;GMT
