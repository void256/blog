  content: "Hi there,\r\n\r\ni couldn't find any contact information so i have to
    go with a comment. I would like to use Nifty Gui on top of my Android game dev
    lib called libgdx. Writting the interfaces needed to have a seperate renderer
    for Nifty GUI seems straight forward. As i understand it only the current trunk
    which is a snapshot version of 1.2 is able to support external renderers, right?
    My question: how stable is the trunk and how stable are the interfaces for renderers&#47;input&#47;sound?
    When to expect the release version of 1.2? Final question: i looked a bit through
    the code but couldn't come to a conclusive answer. Is there a lot of temporary
    object allocations? Android would pretty much choke on that.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    any response,\r\nMario"

  content: "@Mario &#47; @badlogic:\r\n\r\nHi there too :>\r\n\r\nthanks for your
    interest in Nifty GUI! I'll try to answer your questions right here:\r\n\r\n>
    i couldn&rsquo;t find any contact information so i have to go with a comment.\r\n\r\nThe
    sf.net project page stated: \"nifty-gui says the best way to get help with its
    software is by using its forum Help.\" The sf.net help forum for Nifty would be
    a great choice. Or sending me a message over sf.net would be possible too but
    your comment right here on the blog is ok with me too :)\r\n\r\n> As i understand
    it only the current trunk which is a snapshot version of 1.2 is able to support
    external renderers, right?\r\n\r\nYes, that's right! Although former Nifty Version
    (1.1) where prepared for that kind of renderer extraction it was finally really
    finished in 1.2-SNAPSHOT which hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n> My question:
    how stable is the trunk and how stable are the interfaces for renderers&#47;input&#47;sound?\r\n\r\nPretty
    stable at the moment. I don't plan to change them. They will be part of Nifty
    1.2 unmodified with 99% confidence ;)\r\n\r\n> When to expect the release version
    of 1.2?\r\n\r\nGood question :) When it's done? xD Well, there are still some
    issues I'd like to fix prior to a 1.2 release and I'd like to have one more feature
    in: localization support. But we're talking more like weeks instead of months.
    It's coming soon.\r\n\r\n> Final question: i looked a bit through the code but
    couldn&rsquo;t come to a conclusive answer. Is there a lot of temporary object
    allocations? Android would pretty much choke on that.\r\n\r\nThat might be an
    issue for Android indeed. I can't say for sure but there are at least some dynamic
    allocations going on. A mobile plattform was not a primary target and Nifty clearly
    hasn't been optimized in this respect. Nifty was developed with desktop systems
    in mind. I'd love to see it work on Android tho :D And I'd be happy to help.\r\n\r\n>
    and i somehow have the impression that the developer is a bit sloppy at times\r\n\r\nDo
    you? Well, maybe you're right :P\r\n\r\nNifty has been in development for about
    3 years now. It started small out of my dissatisfaction with current GUI systems
    for lwjgl&#47;OpenGL&#47;Java at this time. It has grown - sometimes pretty fast
    - in different directions. If I could rewrote it from scratch now (and there are
    some vague plans in my head for Nifty 2.0) I'd probably change some things - this
    is a normal process however because I've learned a lot in the progress of writing
    it! :>\r\n\r\nI'd keep most of the ideas tho and would only express them more
    clearly, I think.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nvoid"

<p>The old Nifty default style <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.lessvoid.com&#47;archives&#47;52">nifty-style-black<&#47;a> was pretty nifty but the new style simply rocks \o&#47;</p>
<p><object width="640" height="456"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" &#47;><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" &#47;><param name="movie" value="http:&#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;moogaloop.swf?clip_id=12094307&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=FF7700&amp;fullscreen=1" &#47;><embed src="http:&#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;moogaloop.swf?clip_id=12094307&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=FF7700&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application&#47;x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="456"><&#47;embed><&#47;object>

<p>... and being very creative with style names we call this one "nifty-style-grey" :D 8)</p>
<p>You can already svn checkout the project from svn here: <a href="https:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.svn.sourceforge.net&#47;svnroot&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-style-grey&#47;trunk">https:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.svn.sourceforge.net&#47;svnroot&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-style-grey&#47;trunk<&#47;a> or browse the source online here <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.svn.sourceforge.net&#47;viewvc&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-style-grey&#47;trunk&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;nifty-gui.svn.sourceforge.net&#47;viewvc&#47;nifty-gui&#47;nifty-style-grey&#47;trunk&#47;<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Together with the "nifty-default-controls" project - which provides the Standard Controls - you can already start to use the shiny new awesome grey design!</p>
<p>A released version will be available together with the upcoming Nifty 1.2 Release.</p>
<p>But remember, Nifty is not at all about the controls only. You can build whatever GUI you like! This new style is meant as another demonstration how shiny and nifty you can make GUIs look with Nifty GUI. But when you are happy with the look of the new style you are of course free to use it or modify it or just stare at it, like I do ;)</p>
<p>Have fun,<br />
void :)</p>
