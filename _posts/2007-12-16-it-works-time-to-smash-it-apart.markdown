<p>Well it works... but as development progresses some, err, bad habits sneak it. There were a lot of features added to nifty in a relative short period of time and some of these features messed up the code as well as internal dependencies (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about...).</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology&#47;dp&#47;0201485672&#47;ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1197801961&amp;sr=8-1" title="Refactoring Book (amazon)"><img src="..&#47;images&#47;book-refactoring.jpg" alt="refactoring book" align="right" border="0" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="240" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>One thing I pretty much hate are inheritance dependencies. Sadly I've just introduced a fairly big one to manage all the controls in Nifty *sigh*</p>
<p>Well it's time to get the refactoring hat on and clean up the mess :)</p>
<p>Btw: If you still need a christmas present (for yourself or some co-worker) I'd higly <font color="#000000">recommend the book:<&#47;font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000000"> "<&#47;font>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler.<&#47;strong></p>
<p>This book rocks :> I've learned a lot from it.</p>
