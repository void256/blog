Nifty user [Alberto](https://github.com/albertonavarro) created a Nifty extension library to easily define the
flow between Nifty screens.

You can find his project on github and more informations on his blog:

* [Nifty-flow explanation (blog)](http://looking4q.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/my-first-open-source-collaboration-when.html)

Maybe you'll find the project helpful as well!
