So, the original blog at http://nifty-gui.lessvoid.com was using Wordpress ... and was hacked end of November O_o

And since we didn't want that to happen again, we've now moved the Blog to github pages. This has the benefit of being static pages only - no database, no wordpress, well, and no comments unfortunately. But there are other ways to connect.

So for now the Nifty GUI blog has it's new home here for the time being :)

PS: Images are still missing for now ... stay tuned
