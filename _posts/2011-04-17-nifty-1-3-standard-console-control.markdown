  content: Still very cool but it's hard to tell what's going on in that video. Maybe
    zoom in?

  content: Yes, that's a valid argument :) maybe I can put some time aside to redo
    that video. I was probably too excited about the console ;)

  content: I checked out and built the 1.3 snapshot but I did not see many of the
    control builders that appear in the documentation. Is the plan to release them
    all at once, or will they appear in SVN as they are ported to Builder API?

  content: did you check out the nifty-default-controls projects? most of the builders
    build controls and so they live in the default-controls-project. there is a subpackage
    "builder" below each of the control implementation packages inside that project.
    all control builders are part of 1.3 and most of them are available in svn or
    in nightly builds already.

<p>Still busy updating the Standard Controls to Nifty 1.3 API. While you're waiting here is a little preview of the new and improved console control which will bring you a control that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>much faster<&#47;li>
<li>now with a scrollbar<&#47;li>
<li>command line completion with the TAB key<&#47;li>
<li>command history<&#47;li>
<li>colored output<&#47;li>
<li>much more friendly API<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Here is the video:</p>
