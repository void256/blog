<p>There is a Nifty editor project started by Cristiano Aguzzi which looks very promising. It allows you to create Nifty GUI XML by simply adding Nifty Elements and Controls with drag'n'drop!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;niftyguieditor.altervista.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;niftyguieditor.altervista.org&#47;<&#47;a></p>
<p>It's a Java Swing application that uses the Nifty Java2D renderer for preview. This means you can change Element properties and see the changes in realtime! Pretty, erm, Nifty! :D</p>
